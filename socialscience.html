 <h2>Suitable soil for avocado's growth</h2>
   <h4>
       Avocado trees thrive in well-aerated and loose soil.<br>
       Limestone, sandy loam and decomposed granite are the main soil types that help in good growth of avocado.<br>
       Avocado trees can tolerate both acidic and alkaline soils, the best pH range for a successful tree ranges between 5 and 7 ph.<br>
       Avocado trees must have good soil drainage for healthy growth.<br>
       Soil with slightly dry conditions are best for the avocado.<br>
       Wet soil with a muddy texture will surely harm the tree.<br>
    </h4>

   <h2>Climate required for avocado</h2>
    <h4>Depending on the race and varieties, avocados can thrive and perform well in climatic conditions ranging from true tropical to warmer parts of the temperate zone.<br>
       Mexican avocados stand up to the coldest winter temperatures, down to -9 degrees celsius, while West Indian types will die in temperatures below freezing, at 0 degree celsius.<br>
       It can not tolerate the hot dry winds and frosts of northern India.<br>
       Climatically, it is grown in tropical or semitropical areas experiencing some rainfall in summer, and in humid, subtropical summer rainfall areas.<br>

   <h2>Where did avocado originate</h2> 
    <h4>They are thought to have originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.<br>
        Avocado trees were first planted in Florida in 1833 and then in California in 1856.<br>
